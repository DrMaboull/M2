- Tell me about yourself ?

Well, my name is Remy V, I'm 22 and I'm living in Avignon during my studies.
I'm from Pierrelatte in Drome where I graduated high school in science.
After that, I didn't know what to do so I dicided to learn something I didn't do yet because I'm quite curious.

I decided to go to Avignon's faculty to begin a computer science bachelor.
Then I went for a master degree in Software Engineering.
Thanks to this, I got skills in software programming (C, C++, Java) and web programming (html, css, php, Javascript, Symfony).
I also did my master's last year with 50% of school time in a company.
I increased my skills in object-oriented languages, organisation and project managment.

I can describe myself as friendly, curious and creative.
I love learning new things during my free time like new languages for example.

Out of computer science, I love practising sports like running or calisthenics.
I want to be the best in everything I do, I'am also motivated and passionate.


- What is your biggest strength ?

I think I'm organised in work. I know how to organise my work to meet the deadline.
Thanks to my last year of master, we had a lot of deadlines to respect for clients.


- Why our company ?

I master alomost all technologies you wrote on your website.
Your company is very important in its activity domain and I want to bring something new to keep this popularity high.
